# Quick Start

This guide will help you get started with Mortymer in just a few minutes.
We'll create a simple API endpoint that demonstrates the core features of Mortymer
by integrating it in a Rails API, let's call it Rails and Mortymer.

## Basic Setup

First, let's create a new Rails application (skip this if you already have one):

```bash
rails new my_api --api
cd my_api
```

## Installation

Add Mortymer to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mortymer'
```

Then install it:

```bash
bundle install
```

Mortymer requires that every class is autoloaded for it to work. This is deafault rails
behavior when running in production, but it is disabled by default on development, so,
we first need to enable eager load

```ruby
# config/environments/development.rb
Rails.application.configure do
  # Settings specified here will take precedence over those in config/application.rb.

  config.eager_load = true # This line is false by default, change it to true

  # other configs hers ...
end
```

In rails environments, Mortymer can automatically create the routes for you, it is not necessary
that you register them one by one.

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  Mortymer::Rails::Routes.new(self).mount_controllers
end
```

## Creating Your First API

Let's build a simple book API to demonstrate Mortymer's key features.

### 1. Define Your Type

Create a Book type that defines the structure of your data:

```ruby
# app/types/book.rb
class Book < Mortymer::Model
  attribute :id, Integer
  attribute :title, String
  attribute :author, String
  attribute :published_year, Integer
end
```

### 2. Create a Service

Create a service to handle business logic:

```ruby
# app/services/book_service.rb
class BookService
  def initialize
    @books = []
  end

  def create_book(title:, author:, published_year:)
    book = Book.new(
      id: next_id,
      title: title,
      author: author,
      published_year: published_year
    )
    @books << book
    book
  end

  def list_books
    @books
  end

  private

  def next_id
    @books.length + 1
  end
end
```

### 3. Create a Controller

Set up your API controller with Mortymer's features:

```ruby
# app/controllers/api/books_controller.rb
module Api
  class BooksController < ApplicationController
    include Mortymer::DependeciesDsl
    include Mortymer::ApiMetadata

    inject BookService, as: :books

    class Empty < Mortymer::Model
    end

    class ListAllBooksOutput < Mortymer::Model
      attribute :books, Array.of(Book)
    end

    class CreateBookInput < Mortymer::Model
      attribute :title, String
      attribute :author, String
      attribute :published_year, Coercible::Integer
    end

    # GET /api/books
    get input: Empty, output: ListAllBooksOutput
    def list_all_books(_params)
      ListAllBooksOutput.new(books: @books.list_books)
    end

    # POST /api/books
    post input: CreateBookInput, output: Book
    def create_book(params)
      @books.create_book(
        title: params.title,
        author: params.author,
        published_year: params.published_year
      )
    end
  end
end
```

## Testing Your API

Start your Rails server:

```bash
rails server
```

Create a new book:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/books \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "The Ruby Way",
    "author": "Hal Fulton",
    "published_year": 2015
  }'
```

List all books:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/books
```

## Key Features Demonstrated

This simple example showcases several of Mortymer's powerful features:

- âœ¨ **Type System**: Strong typing with `Mortymer::Models` which are powered by `Dry::Struct`
- ðŸ”Œ **Dependency Injection**: Clean service injection with `inject :book_service`
- âœ… **Parameter Validation**: Built-in request validation in controllers
